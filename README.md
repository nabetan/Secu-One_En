# Secu-One

## 1  What is Secure-One?
It is a card game for learning effective defense measures against cyber attacks.
Defense cards are utilized by “The CIS Critical Security Controls (CSC)” which is a 
standard that summarizes effective defense measures against known attack methods.  

## 2 Overview of cards  
There are two types of card sets, attack cards and defense cards. Defense cards 
contain CSC controls to protect against cyber attack methods. Attack cards contain 
representative attack methods. There are two attack card sets, Type A and Type B, and 
one of them is used in the game. The images of the cards are shown below.  

## 3  Rule of the game  
(1) Distribute 10 defence cards to each participant.  
(2) An arbitrary player becomes the leader of the game and draws a card from the attack 
card set, and places it so that the front side can be seen.  
(3) Players submit the hand-held defensive cards considered valid for the presented 
attack card; there is no particular order, the first player who thinks his card is valid 
submits it and so on.  
(4) A player can submit two cards on his/her turn, but he/she is not allowed to duplicate 
the same category of cards (CSC number).  
(5) On his/her turn, a player needs to explain to the other players why the defense 
card(s) is (are) valid for the attack card.  
(6) A player gains points if the other players agree with his/her explanation. If two or 
more players have submitted defense cards, the player who submitted earlier gets the 
highest score and so on.  
Ex.) In the case of five players, the player who first submitted the defense card can get 
5 points, the player who second submitted it can get 4 points, the player who third 
submitted it can get 3 points, the player who fourth submitted it can get 2 points, and 
the player who fifth submitted it can get 1 point.
In case some players have submitted multiple cards, you cannot gain points but can 
protect the damages.  
(7) If players use important CSC controls (CSC 1 to 6), they can acquire higher scores 
than the other CSC controls.  
*Points that can be obtained in (6) will be doubled.  
(8) The game master will judge the effectiveness of controls if players cannot judge 
them because there is one or more non-consenting players.  
(9) A player cannot gain points if all the other players disagree, or the game master 
cannot judge the effectiveness. The submitted cards will be returned to the other players, 
and the player cannot participate in the next turn of the game.  
(10) Players can draw a card from the deck of defense cards once per turn.  
(11) Players who failed to submit defense cards or who were unable to explain their 
effectiveness, need to subtract the points stated on the attack card from their points.  
(12) Players record points, reasons why the defense cards are effective, etc. on their 
point recording table.  
(13) The player who first submitted the defense card in the previous turn becomes the 
leader and they repeat (2) - (12).  
(14) The game termination condition is one of the following.  
 *There is no attack card.  
 *All players have no hands  
 *A certain period of time has passed since the game had been started.  
(15) At the end of the game, the player with the highest point becomes the winner.
